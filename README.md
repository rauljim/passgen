# passgen
 Password generator inspired by XKCD
 
This is basically an attempt to reimplement this XKCD-inspired password generator:

I just thought it would be fun to write my own version of this nice tool in Python 3. I keep most
of the interface the same, the actual implementation is written from scratch.
